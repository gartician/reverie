# Work

## Computational Biologist | Jun 2019 - Present

**Dr. Julia Maxson Lab**

* Characterizing the epigenetic landscape of acute myeloid leukemia

* Investigating the mechanisms of novel drug combination therapies

* Analyzing and interpreting NGS data with bench scientists to drive projects forward

* Developing, re-purposing, and maintaining pipelines to analyze and re-analyze NGS data

* Contribute analysis methods to manuscripts

## Graduate Researcher | Apr 2019 - Apr 2020

**_Dr. Rohner Lab_**

* Refined an analysis pipeline to identify genetic variants that leads to phenotypic differences in mexican cavefish Astyanax Mexicanus using bash, python, R, and GATK (40+ samples, 3 conditions, > 500 FASTQ files).
* Discovered 2+ genetic variants (SNPs and indels) in blind, eye-less cavefish Astyanax Mexicanus that leads to abnormal lens development.
* Frequently tailored complex concepts of variant-calling algorithms to an interdisciplinary team of 3 scientists; drafted the computational section for the upcoming manuscript.

**_Dr. Rohner Lab_**
* Developed a pipeline using bash, python, and R, to quantify transcript levels in RNA-Seq dataset (7 time points, 4 replicates, 2 conditions).
* Results were packaged into an R Shiny app for 10+ lab members to view gene expression over time and condition. 

## Graduate Student Researcher | Oct 2018 - Apr 2019

**Dr. Karen Guillemin Lab**

* Developed an analysis pipeline using Seurat to process single-cell RNA-Seq data (40K cells, 2 conditions) in R.

* Investigated single-cell transcriptomic differences in zebrafish raised in either germ-free (sterile) or conventional (with bacteria) environments to infer the effects of the microbiota on host development.

* Discovered a family of 50+ genes that may be involved in abnormal development in germ-free fish.

## General Chemistry Lab TA | Sept 2018 – Dec 2018

Taught two sections of General Chemistry lab (30 total students) at University of Oregon, helped students one-on-one during office hours, and resolved grading conflicts with students and  head professors.

## Waiter | Oct 2018 – Jun 2019

Worked in a team at Thai Chili to help serve customers in the storefront, reported daily  revenue, trained 5 employees, and frequently communicated with 70+  customers per shift.

## TRiO Tutor | 2014 – 2018

As a TRiO tutor at Oregon State University, I participated in team-building activities between tutors,  assessed teaching performance with an advisor 2 times per term, and  tutored 20+ students in math and science classes throughout my three  years of experience. Classes I’ve tutored included general biology and chemistry, algebra to vector calculus, and scientific writing.
